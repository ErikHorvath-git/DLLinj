## Compilation Guide

### 1. Test DLL (Windows)
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -shared -o testdll.dll dll/testdll.cpp -luser32
2. Encryptors
Linux:

bash
g++ encryptors/LinuxDllEncryptor.cpp -o encrypt -lcrypto
./encrypt testdll.dll mypass123
Windows:

cmd
cl encryptors/windowsDllEncryptor.cpp /link advapi32.lib
encryptor.exe testdll.dll mypass123
3. Injector (Windows)
cmd
cl injector/inj.cpp /EHsc /link advapi32.lib user32.lib
Usage Protocol
Generate encrypted payload hex array

Insert into inj.cpp at specified location

Execute against test process:

cmd
inj.exe [PID] [METHOD]
Available methods:
1 - Basic injection
2 - Advanced mapping
3 - Stealth variant

Safety Protocols
Automatic sandbox detection

No persistent artifacts

Requires elevated privileges

Built-in payload verification

## Build Instructions

### 1. Test Payload (DLL)
```bash
# Cross-compile from Linux:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -shared -o testdll.dll dll/testdll.cpp -luser32 -Wall

# Native Windows:
cl /LD dll/testdll.cpp user32.lib
2. Encryption Tools
Linux/MacOS:

bash
g++ encryptors/LinuxDllEncryptor.cpp -o encrypt -lcrypto
./encrypt testdll.dll research_key
Windows:

cmd
cl encryptors/WindowsDllEncryptor.cpp /link advapi32.lib
WindowsDllEncryptor.exe testdll.dll research_key
3. Loader Module
cmd
cl injector/inj.cpp /EHsc /link advapi32.lib user32.lib
Research Protocol
Generate payload:

bash
make_payload.sh -t dll -o diagnostic.x
Prepare loader:

bash
configure_loader.py -m 2 -k research_key
