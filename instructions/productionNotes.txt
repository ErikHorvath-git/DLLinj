Testing Notes:

Uses Wine for demonstration (real testing should use Windows)

Replace [PID] with actual process ID

Method 2 (manual mapping) leaves least traces

For Production Use:
• Replace wine with actual Windows target
• Use physical memory tools for verification
• Consider TPM-backed memory encryption
